# Recipe for one sourdough boule

![Sesame Sourdough](images/sesame_sourdough.jpeg)

**Using my sourdough starter recipe found [here](sourdough_starter.md)**

### Some tips to remember as your make this recipe ###
1. Bread making is much more about technique than ingredients. Do not rush or skip steps, and don't be afraid to find resources to understand each technique. 
2. Your dough is going to feel very wet, and in the beginning very sticky. Do not add any flour, or any other ingredients to this recipe, it will come together, trust the process.
3. Temperature and times are all critical to this dough rising and eventually forming a great bread. The process here is slow, and results in delicious bread, but all steps are needed, nothing can be skipped.
4. Air kills your dough by removing moisture and allowing crusts to form, keep your dough and levain covered as much as possible throughout the bread making. 

## Timing ##
I have assembled a timing guide that should work with most peoples daily schedules and results in as little work as possible though the 27+ hour process.

**Each step is described in the below sections**

### Step Timing ###
**Day One**

1. 09:00 AM - Make the Levain
2. 12:30 PM - Autolyse the Main Dough
3. 02:00 PM - Mix the Final Dough
4. 02:30 PM - Begin Bulk Fermentation
5. 06:45 PM - Preshape the Dough
6. 07:15 PM - Final Shaping
7. 07:25 PM - Warm Proofing
8. 07:45 PM - Cold Proofing

**Day Two**

1. 09:00 AM - Preheat the Oven
2. 10:00 AM - Bake with Steam
3. 10:20 AM - Final Bake
4. 10:45 AM - Cool
5. 12:45 AM - Eat!

## Make the Levain (Day One, 9:00am) ##
_Note: this recipe will make extra levain, for loss in jars and on spoons as you make the bread recipe_

#### Levain Ingredients ####
* 50 grams Unbleached Bread Flour
* 25 grams Sourdough Starter
* 50 grams Tepid Water

Mix the levain and let sit covered in a warm part of your house (**26 degrees celsius is best**) until doubled in size (roughly 5 hours)


## Autolyse the Main Dough (Day One, 12:30pm) ##

**With 1.5 hours remaining until Levain is ready, begin autolysing your dough.**

Mix together that main dough ingredients until all of the flour and salt has been combined with the water, into a shaggy mass. Do not kneed. 

Cover and store in the same area / temperature as the Levain  

#### Main Dough Ingredients ####
* 315g Unbleached Bread Flour
* 100g Red Wheat Flour
* 280g Tepid Water
* 10g Salt


## Make the Final Dough (Day One, 2:00pm) ##
**When your levain is ready, mix 90 grams of levain into the dough, and mix until fully combined**

To do this, pour the levain evenly over the main dough, and press your fingers through the levain and into the dough several times to evenly distribute the levain into the dough. Then mix together until both the main dough and the levain are incorporated. 

Rest covered for 30 minutes before proceeding with Bulk Fermentation


## Bulk Fermentation (Day One, 2:30pm) ##
**Bulk fermentation is a process where the Dough is stretched and then let to rest is cycles as the yeast works to ferment the flour and water**

There are two techniques you need to perform during Bulk Fermentation:

#### Stretch and Fold ####
This process is where you simply stretch edges of the dough out, then fold the stretched section on top of the main mass of the dough.

**To Stretch and Fold:**

1. Wet both of your hands
2. Uncover the dough
3. Reaching into the bowl, grasp one side of the dough and stretch it out of the  container until it strongly resists, do not let it rip
4. Wiggle the stretched portion a bit to get a little more stretch
5. Fold the stretched portion back into the container over the top of the main mass of dough all the way to the opposing side of the dough
6. Gently, but firmly press the stretched end into the main mass
7. Rotate your bowl 180 degrees
8. Grab the opposing edge of the dough, and the newly stretched potion
9. Stretch that side of the dough as you did previously, wiggling and pressing that stretched portion over the main mass
10. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and stretch and fold the other remaining sides of the dough
11. Complete this process 2 times, or until the dough resits enough that you are not able to stretch the dough more than a few inches
12. Cover the dough again, and rest

#### Coil Fold ####
This process is a little different is is performed in the last half of the bulk fermentation, the dough gets essentially the same stretch, but Coil Folding is gentler than a stretch and fold, and will disturb the dough less. 

**A Coil fold is one where the main dough mass is lifted in the middle, then placed back on top of the dangling edges of the dough.** 

*You can think of this technique as a stretch and fold, but upside down*

**To Coil Fold:**

1. Wet both of your hands
2. Uncover the dough
3. Reaching into the bowl, work your fingers and palms underneath the dough from opposing sides until your finger tips meet underneath the dough mass
4. Lift the dough, allowing for the sides not covered by your hands to stretch as they naturally want to maintain contact with the bowl
5. Continue lifting the dough until you have disconnected the dough from the bowl, the side farthest from you and the side closes to you should have stretched by 8-10 inches
6. Lay the dough back down over top of the stretched sides, keep the centre of the dough in the centre
7. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat the coil fold
8. Do this only once, so that you have folded in both directions
9. Cover the dough again, and rest


### Bulk Fermentation Timing ###
During bulk fermentation, follow this timing and process to develop the gluten and ferment the dough.

**This process should take 1 hour and 45 minutes**

Begin:

1. Stretch and fold the dough (Day One, 2:30pm)
2. Rest covered for 15 minutes
3. Stretch and fold the dough (Day One, 2:45pm)
4. Rest covered for 15 minutes
5. Stretch and fold the dough (Day One, 3:00pm)
6. Rest covered for 15 minutes
7. Coil fold the dough (Day One, 3:15pm)
8. Rest for 30 minutes
9. Coil fold the dough (Day One, 3:45pm)
10. Rest for 30 minutes
11. Coil fold the dough (Day One, 4:15pm)
12. Rest covered in a warm location for remainder of time until Pre-shaping (for 1.5 hours)

## Pre-shape the Dough (Day One, 6:45pm) ##

**For all shaping you will need to master a technique using your kitchen countertop and a baking bench scraper, which will allow you to shape your dough into a taught ball**

Remove your dough from the container and place it onto a flat, clean, un-floured, dry, room temperature surface, like a kitchen countertop.

To pre-shape the boule:

1. Stretch the dough out into a square about a foot wide
2. Mentally dividing the dough into 3 tall rectangles, fold the left side over the middle and pat down gently 
3. then fold or role the elongated rectangle.
1. Place 6h 

#### Shaping into a ball ####


Let rest for 15 minutes

## Final Shaping (Day One, 7:15pm) ##

Final shaping, reshape the dough, tighter than before, and flip into banneton, stitching once placed.

## Warm Proofing (Day One, 7:25pm) ##

Cover and leave on countertop for 20 minutes

## Cold Proofing (Day One, 7:45pm) ##

Cover and put into fridge for max 12 hours


## Preheat the Oven (Day Two, 9:00am) ##

Placing your dutch oven inside of your oven, preheat your oven to 500f for 1 hour.
You want the oven hot, and the dutch oven hot, so let this time go far past the preheat bell on your oven.

## Preparing to bake and Scoring (Day Two, 9:55am) ##

**Using a bread lame, score your boule in any particular pattern you like.**

*A 'lame' is a tool used for scoring bread. It typically consists of a razor blade, with a handle for articulation*

Tips for scoring:

* Cut with a slashing motion, don't hack at the dough like you would if you were using a saw or a bread knife, one single confident motion is what you want.
* You should be aiming for a cut of about half an inch or less, you want to get into the bread however you don't want to destroy the structure.
* Cutting straight down will open the bread up just fine, however cutting while holding the blade on an angle will cause one of the sides to lift and peal back, creating an 'ear' which is quite desirable.

## Bake with Steam (Day Two, 10:00am) ##

Bake for 15 minutes

## Final Bake (Day Two, 10:15am) ##

remove cover and reduce temperature to 450f
bake for 20 minutes @ 450f

check and bake for an additional 5 minutes if needed / desired 

## Cool (Day Two, 10:45am) ##

It will be tempting, but just let it cool for 2 hours. A wire rack is best to allow for air circulation.

## Eat (Day Two, 12:45pm) ##

The step that needs no explanation

## Store ##

If there is any left, let it completely cool and then wrap in plastic wrap or aluminum foil. You can use breadboxes or tupperware, just ensure that it is an airtight seal. Consume within a couple days.
